# Spam SMS Classifier using NLTK & Scikit-learn
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset is processed using NLTK, and classification is done using various Scikit-learn models.
# Features
Preprocesses raw SMS data: removes punctuation, symbols, numbers, URLs, etc.

Tokenizes and stems text using nltk.

Creates a Bag of Words model using the 1500 most frequent terms.

Trains multiple classifiers:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Implements an ensemble Voting Classifier

Evaluates accuracy and performance with:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Dataset used: spam.csv

Contains two main columns:

v1: Label (ham or spam)

v2: SMS text

# Confusion Matrix Example

              predicted
               ham  spam
actual ham     1213    5
       spam      15   170
